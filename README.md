TOP's foundations final project: The Calculator

## Reflection
This one was a doozy! Creating a calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's honestly crazy how much went into making this little functional website, but I'm glad I was able to figure it out. The hardest part was definitely finding and tweaking the logic for each button's behavior based on whether other buttons had been clicked. I believe I was able to find the best solution for me - which was string appending and storing values for whether an operator had been clicked and whether there were 2 values ready to compute. Try it out and let me know if there are any bugs or features I need to fix/add!
